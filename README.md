"# Vehicle_Localization_SensorFusion_Using_GNSS_and_IMU" 

Two pivotal sensors are useed here: GPS & IMU. The objective is to comprehend the advantages and limitations of each sensor and to gain foundational knowledge in sensor fusion. The project emphasizes hands-on experience, requiring to collect data using both sensors in real-world driving scenarios. Post data collection, the analysis phase involves tasks like magnetometer calibration, sensor fusion for yaw estimation, forward velocity estimation, and dead reckoning using IMU data. The data is compared with the IMU-based navigation results with GPS data, fostering a deeper understanding of sensor-based navigation.
